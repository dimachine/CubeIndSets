# CubeIndSets

The code and experiment protocols for counting maximal independent sets in the hypercube covergraph.

* Part 1. Counting maximal independent sets up to n=6 (https://oeis.org/A284707).
* Part 2. Computing maximal independent set polynomials up to n=6.

The concept lattices of the contexts (*.cxt) contains all maximal bicliques in the adjacency matrices of n-hypercube Q_n.
